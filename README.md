# First Assignment

This assignment is about functions, vectors, and strings. It would be a good idea to use also git (if you are brave enough).

### Write Functions ###

Starting with a `vector<string>`, you are required to write the following functions:

1. a function `print` that prints the `vector<string>`;
2. a function `string_lengths` that takes a `vector<string>` as argument and returns a `vector<int>` with the number of characters in each `string`;
3. a function `longest_string` that returns the longest string in a `vector<string>`;
4. a function `shortest_string` that returns the shortest string in a `vector<string>`, if two or more strings have the same lenght, the function return the first one;
5. a function `alpha_first_string` that returns the lexicographically first string in a `vector<string>`;
6. a function `alpha_last_string` that returns the lexicographically last string in a `vector<string>`;

The assignment already provides a `main.cpp` file. While you proceed with the implementation of the functions, you should uncomment the function calls.
You are done when your output looks as:

```
Vector of strings:
{ first second third fourth fifth sixth seventh  }
Vector of lengths:
{ 5 6 5 6 5 5 7  }
Longest string: seventh
Shortest string: first
Lexicographically first string: fifth
Lexicographically last string: third

```


### Create Files ###

Finally, move the functions' code to a new `cpp` file, create the header file, and modify the `main.cpp` file accordingly.


If you have any question, just write on the forum of the course.
